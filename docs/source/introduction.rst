Introduction
============
This book presents Common Student Errors (CSEs) that have been made by first year students taking Engineering Mathematics e-examinations at the University of the West of England, Bristol (UWE, Bristol). The CSEs presented in this document were collected from 2017-2019 as part of the Common Student Errors Project (CSE Project at UWE) conducted at UWE, Bristol. This research has been conducted by Indunil Sikurajapathi for her Doctoral studies under the guidance of Dr Karen Henderson and Dr Rhys Gwynllyw.

This book is organised as follows. In Section 1.1 and Section 1.2 we present a brief background of Common Student Errors (CSEs) and the Dewis e-Assessment System. Then we explain how we conducted the CSE Project at UWE, Bristol in Section 1.3 and the present the CSEs Collection found during the project in Section 1.4. The taxonomy coding utilised to classify the CSEs in e-Assessments found in this project is discussed in detail in Section 1.5. After that we provide a Guide to the CSE recording template in Section 1.6 which is used in the subsequent Sections 2-23 to present all of the 65 CSEs found to date during the CSE Project at UWE, Bristol.

One of the special features of this book is that it provides hyperlinks to each question on the Dewis e-Assessment System in order to facilitate the reader to try these questions online. If any of the identified CSEs are submitted as answers, then enhanced feedback will be provided, which aims to correct any misconceptions in a timely manner.
The information in this book may be used to inform teachers so that they can provide students with a better understanding of the mathematical skills and knowledge while teaching the subject. It may also be useful for institutions as they can utilise it in the future development of teaching materials to ensure that these CSEs will be addressed. Further, the content of this book can be used to develop support materials and resources to address CSEs which will help students to acquire better understanding of mathematics. In addition, students who learn mathematics at university level or in secondary school can refer to this booklet to address their misconceptions and can try the Dewis questions several times. Since, in each attempt, Dewis produces questions with random parameters, student can use this facility to correct their misconceptions by practicing the same question but with different parameters.

We anticipate that this book will be useful to identify and address some misconceptions that students have in mathematics. We plan to continue with this research and will update the book if we find new CSEs in the future.
